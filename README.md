# IMAWAY

## Description

ImAway is a simple interface that allows for the scheduling of jobs between employers and caregivers. 

<!-- ## Installation

After forking and cloning this repository, run:

### `bundle install`
### `rails db:migrate`
### `npm install --prefix client`

Seeding the database is optional. If you would like to see example users and jobs upon starting the app, run:

### `rails db:seed`

If you skip this step, you can sign up users and create jobs of your choosing to see the app in action.

## Running the App

To start the backend on [https://localhost:3000], run:
### `rails s`

To start the frontend on [https://localhost:4000], run:
### `npm start --prefix client`

Running 
### `rails start` 
will run the frontend and backend together with one command. -->

## Use

When the app is opened, there will be a login page. When you sign up for ImAway, you’ll be taken to the home page where you can use the navigation bar to view jobs, your profile, and others’ profiles. As a caregiver, you can view available jobs and express your interest in them to send an alert to the employer, who can either accept or reject your request. Once you are assigned to a job, you can view all upcoming jobs in your profile. As an employer, you can create a job and accept or reject any caregivers who request it. This will send them an alert and add your job to your “upcoming” section in your profile. To view another person’s profile, click their name where it appears on the respective job.
